The file i18nFolderList.txt from this folder contains a list of directories.
Those directories are processed by "pki18nlst" - a product of PK's build to produce a template .pot file.
This happens during the copy exports phase, after a successful build.
This template file is to be used to create .po and compile .mo files for transation of the library strings.
A good tool to do this is POEdit.
